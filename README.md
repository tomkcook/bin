# Useful scripts

I keep these here so I can sync them to new machines easily.  Feel free to use anything you find useful.

## Scripts:

* docker-relabel - relabel a docker image, useful for moving to a new registry
* ec - shortcut for `emacsclient $@` that auto-detaches from the tty
* git-bare-update - update a bare git repository from a remote origin.  Fetches all the branches and tags from the remote (no, there is no way to do this easily in stock git).  Once installed, `git bare-update`.
* git-current-branch - shortcut to print the name of the current branch of the current repository.
* git-find-file - find a file in all branches of the current git repository.  Useful for "I know I was working on that in ''one'' of these branches somewhere..."
* repos - list all tags associated with a particular docker image, with optional filtering.
